# Geemu Nihongo (ゲーム 日本語)

A selection of video game related definitions for Japanese, in English.

## Overall goal

Attempt to make it practical to navigate Japanese-only video games while only knowing enough Japanse to type in parts of words/phrases when seeing tham on a menu etc.

## Plan

* Collect definitions relevant to Japanese video games
* Make it easy to search/filter them, preferably with a minimum of typing
    * Possibly useful additions
        * Tagging of defintions into categories, allow filtering results to subset of tags
            * Menu
            * HUD
            * RPG stats
            * Item names
            * Parts of speech
